# Managing API keys

To request restricted information from the API, you need to add an API key to your requests, so that the system can identify you. You can create API keys in your App-Arena Developer Account.

If you do not have access to the developer section yet, please drop us an email to s.buckpesch at iconsultants.eu with your contact data and will we get in touch with you and sent you an API key.
